**FINDINGS:**

- The gravid uterus shows a smooth-walled gestational sac.
- A fetal pole is seen with appreciated cardiac activity, indicating active embryonic development.
- Decidual reaction is noted as good.
- CRL (Crown-Rump Length) measures at 3 mm, suggesting a gestational age of approximately 5 weeks and 6 days.

**COMMENTS:**

This ultrasound represents an early intrauterine pregnancy with a gestational age of 5 weeks and 6 days. The presence of cardiac activity within the fetal pole suggests normal progression. Notably, a small blood collection near the internal os has been identified, which warrants monitoring but is not uncommon in early pregnancies.

Delayed conception is noted, with an updated ultrasound expected on 30th August 2025 for further evaluation and assessment of gestational progress.

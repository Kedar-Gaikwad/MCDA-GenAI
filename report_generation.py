Goal: Take anonymized audio notes and generate a structured report based on the extracted information. The content of the report should resemble clinical notes as closely as possible, containing patient information, FINDINGS, and comments.

You will be provided with the following examples:

Four anonymized clinical notes from sonography sessions
Corresponding anonymized audio notes (Note: Audio recordings may contain less information than the clinical notes).

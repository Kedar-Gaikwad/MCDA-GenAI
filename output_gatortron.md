**Gestational Age (D):** 7 weeks  
**EDD:** 22nd August 2025  

**FINDINGS:**

- **Uterus/Gestation Sac:** The gravid uterus shows a smooth-walled gestation sac. A fetal pole is visible with appreciated cardiac activity, indicating active development.
  
- **Decidual Reaction:** Good decidual reaction observed.

- **CRL (Crown-Rump Length):** 3 mm

- **Gestational Age in Weeks:** Corresponding to 5 weeks and 6 days.

- **Blood Collection:** A tiny blood collection is noted just above the internal os, measuring 5.9 x 2.8 mm.

- **Cervix Measurement:** Cervix length is 4 cm.

**COMMENTS:**

The findings suggest an early intrauterine pregnancy with a gestational age of approximately 5 weeks and 6 days. There is evidence of delayed conception, as indicated by the timing relative to LMP. The presence of a tiny blood collection above the internal os warrants monitoring but is not uncommon in early pregnancies.

**Follow-up:**  
A follow-up ultrasound examination (UIGDD) scheduled for 30th August 2025 is advised to monitor progress and ensure continued healthy development.
